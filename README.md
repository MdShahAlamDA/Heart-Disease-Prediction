# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Analysis  
This project is part of the **Dynamix Networks Data Analytics Internship**.

## 📌 Objective  
To analyze medical data and build a machine learning model to predict whether a person has heart disease.  
The goal is to understand:
- Key health risk factors  
- Patterns in patient characteristics  
- How accurately ML models can detect heart disease  

## 📊 Tasks Performed  

### ✔ Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values  
- Removed inconsistencies  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Standardized numerical features  
- Converted data types  

### ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Age distribution  
- Gender-based comparison  
- Cholesterol trends  
- Chest pain types  
- Correlation heatmap  

### ✔ Model Building  
Tested multiple models:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Decision Tree  
- KNN  

Evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  

### ✔ Visualizations  
(Available inside the `images/` folder if added)
- Bar chart: Heart disease cases by age  
- Pie chart: Gender distribution  
- Heatmap: Feature correlations  
- Line chart: Cholesterol across age  
- Confusion matrix visualization  

## 📈 Insights  
1. Patients above age 50 showed higher risk.  
2. Males had slightly more heart disease cases.  
3. High cholesterol and resting blood pressure strongly influenced risk.  
4. Exercise-induced angina was a major factor.  

## 👨‍💻 Tools Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Power BI  

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Strong correlation between age, cholesterol & heart disease.  
- Logistic Regression performed moderately.  
- Tree-based models captured patterns better.  
- Dashboard highlights high-risk groups clearly.
